This package provides high-level
one-shot functions for linear and mixed-integer programming (``linprog`` and ``mixintprog``),
as well as a solver-independent low-level interface for implementing advanced techniques
that require efficiently solving a sequence of linear programming problems.

Supported LP solvers are ``Clp``, ``Gurobi``, and ``GLPK``. Supported MIP solvers are ``Cbc``, ``Gurobi``, and ``GLPK``. The corresponding solver packages (of the same name, except for ``GLPKMathProgInterface``) must be installed first. 

The interface is fully documented **[here]**.
